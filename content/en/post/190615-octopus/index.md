The squid with a dual personality shows anger on a half body and sex appeal on the other half.
The octopus that feels visual information by the whole body changes the appearance of the whole body like LCD in an instance by using the highly developed nervous system.
A lot more about the secrets of cephalopods are shown in this TED talk.

When I was a university student, I observed the skin of a squit by a binocular and was astonished to found a regular organization of pigments of red, green, and blue, which changes the appearance of the skin by changing their sizes.
The skin was actually like an LCD.
The above TED talk explains that octopus can feel light by their skin and change their skin pattern by the nervous system spread throughout their skin.
It is wonderful information processing system which integrates the sensory system, information processing system, and motor system.
